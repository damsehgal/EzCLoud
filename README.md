# EzCLoud
Why use other cloud services when you can have EzCloud . The only Cloud service which does not take your info nor
checks if your file contains an anonymous message. 
What's more , you can have different versions of a same file just like git .
You can even send pull requests to other members . No One can see your files less you wish to share them .
